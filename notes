Lock harder things initially so the player doesn't feel overwhelmed by the number of rules/objects/monsters/rooms
and has an easier time just playing through and learning the basics. Unlock more things as the player wins runs.

Don't use hunger clocks.

Can only hold one item, having to manage resources/buffs appropriately. Make sure that each level-room1(room2) group 
has many possible opportunities for trading resources so the player can go back and forth between rooms and take advantage
of whatever he wants.

Easier than normal roguelike difficulty curve at first (easier to start, but then progresses normally 
(which means pretty fucking hard)) but also add Bastion-like "prayers" that let more experienced players 
make runs harder if they want to.

Enemies won't be melee only, so need to figure out a way of making sure the player can easily tell which projectiles
are his and which aren't.
